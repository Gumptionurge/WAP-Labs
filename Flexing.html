<h1>THIS IS HOW THE FUCKIN COOKIE CRUMBLES TO HUMAN ASHES, RIGHT?</h1>

    <p class="align">The prominent Palestinian American scholar Rashid Khalidi recalls feeling
        overwhelmingly outnumbered at Columbia University in 2003 when pro-Israel
        advocates protested against him and other faculty and students who spoke out
        against Israel amid intense fighting in Gaza and the West Bank.
        News crews hounded him on campus, and pro-Israel students made a
        documentary about the controversy. “I think the narrative was pretty firmly
        in the hands of people who supported Israel,” he says. But, he continues,
        “there’s a generational change taking place, with young people having an
        entirely different set of views. They consume different media. I think they’re
        more educated, more worldly, and better informed than their elders.”</p>

            The old guard is pushing back. In addition to the firings and calls for
            investigations into SJP, two law firms rescinded job offers to students
            for statements blaming Israel alone for the 7 October attacks. One of the firms,
            Davis Polk, is reconsidering its decision for two of three students,
            who said they hadn’t approved the letters. Billionaire donors have threatened
            to pull donations to top universities if the institutions don’t condemn Hamas
            and crack down on criticism of Israel on campus. Meanwhile, circling “doxxing trucks”
            sponsored by rightwing activists display the faces and personal details of
            pro-Palestine students at Harvard and Columbia, calling them “antisemites”.
